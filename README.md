Write a function named `countBlanks` that counts the number of blank strings in an array.

the function should expect an array of strings to be passed in and should return the number of blanks.

```javascript
countBlanks(["cake", "pudding", ""]) // => 1
countBlanks(["cake"]) // => 0

var list = ["cake", "  ", "pudding", ""]
countBlanks(list) // => 2
countBlanks(["", " ", "  "]) // => 3
```
